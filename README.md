# Security Data Analysis Lab
An introductory lab to Security Data Analysis (using Apache Metron (incubating)).

## How to clone this branch
* `git clone https://github.com/JonZeolla/lab-SecurityDataAnalysis`
  * Clone the latest revision of the lab-SecurityDataAnalysis repo.
* `git clone -b 2017-02-09_SCIS_SecurityDataAnalysis https://github.com/JonZeolla/lab-SecurityDataAnalysis`
  * This will only work after 2017-02-09.  It will clone the revision of the lab-SecurityDataAnalysis repo used during the 2017-02-09 Steel City InfoSec lab.  Cloning any of the pointers (tags) will put you in a detached HEAD state, which is expected.
